        <h1>Gracie Stone</h1>
        <h2>Web Designer</h2>

        <p>I am 20 years old and living in North Carolina.  I was adopted from Cambodia when I was very young. I have a three year old Pug who is quite the handful at times.  </p>
        <p>I have always been into the creative arts.  I took web design classes throughout high school as well as some in college.  I have always had an attraction towards film but I do not get to do it as much as I would like. I like to be hands on with things as it always keeps me busy and engaged. </p>

          <h3>Paint by Numbers</h3>
          <img src="images/painting.jpg" alt="paint by numbers">
          <p>I painted this photograph for my girlfriend to hang up in her apartment at school. It was a custom paint by numbers so there was not much free hand involved. It turned out better than I first expected it to. </p>
